# Historical background created of the Cascading Style Sheets.

- Cascading Style Sheets was first proposed in 1994.
	- The authors can only mark a piece of content as paragraph,as heading of some level, as preformatted text, or one of other element types.
	- To configure browser to make all level-one-heading tiny and pink and all level-six headings huge and red, that only was users lookout.

So the CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) was introduced that goal to provide a simple,declarative styling language that was flexible for authors.

- CSS1 was completed at the end of 1996.
	- While the newly established CSS Working Group moved forward to the CSS2.
	- There were also some unfortunate missteps in early implementations, such as the infamous discrepancy in box model implementations.
